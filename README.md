# Goldstar Developer API


At Goldstar, we love live entertainment and we want to make it easy for everyone else to go out more and love it as much as we do.  The Goldstar Developer API makes it easy to build applications to help users find, discover and fall in love with live entertainment. The Goldstar API typically offers more than 3,000 unique events and 15,000 shows at any time across all 26 Goldstar territories. 


The API allows you to display event listings directly on your website or in your mobile app.  After finding a great concert, theater performance, comedy show or sporting event on your site or in your mobile app, the user is sent to Goldstar to select dates, times and seating sections before  completing their ticket purchase.  

If you’re interested in giving your users the opportunity to purchase Goldstar tickets directly in your shopping cart, visit <https://goldstar.com/company/distribution-partners> or [email us](partnerships@goldstar.com) to learn more about our transactional APIs.  

## Overview

The Goldstar Developer API is available in XML and JSON formats and allows you to tap into all of Goldstar’s events, or a subset of events based on the Territory or Category you’re interested in.  API calls return events in order of popularity with the most popular events listed first.

Goldstar’s feeds are not intended to be used in real time or by your individual users. We recommend that you request the feeds no more than once every 15 minutes.


Occasionally, we’re able to customize our API to fit the specific needs of our partners. If this is something you’d be interested in, [email us](partnerships@goldstar.com) and let us know what you’re looking for.


## Authentication

All requests to the Goldstar Developer API require a valid API key. If you have not yet obtained an API key, you can request one by [emailing us](partnerships@goldstar.com).  To authenticate your request, you’ll need to add your API key to the end of any valid URL. For example: `https://www.goldstar.com/api/territories.json?api_key=<api_key>`


In addition, you’ll need an Affiliate ID in order to generate unique tracking links and get credit for the traffic you send to us. If you haven’t yet received an Affiliate ID, apply at <https://affiliates.goldstar.com/signup>.  



## Concepts

* **Categories**: Genres of events, like Music or Sports,  Goldstar offers.

* **Territories**: Geographic areas Goldstar has established that roughly map to U.S. Census Bureau Designated Market Areas (DMA).

* **Listings**: Event listings consist of a set of data fields like event title, description, dates, times, location, etc.


## Categories

Categories are genres of events Goldstar offers.  

The Category reflects  content (e.g. "Theatre"), context (e.g. "Good for Groups"), or a seasonal promotion (e.g. "Summer Concerts").  The list of potential Categories changes regularly with new Categories being added and others being deactivated. 


To obtain Goldstar’s current list of Categories, use the Categories Call:

JSON: `https://www.goldstar.com/api/categories.json?api_key=<api_key>`

XML: `https://www.goldstar.com/api/categories.xml?api_key=<api_key>`


#### Example Request:

	https://www.goldstar.com/api/categories.json?api_key=<api_key>

| id		   | integer       | The Category's ID|
| name | string  | The name of the Category |

Once you have information about Goldstar’s current Categories, you can use the Category ID to request events in a particular Category.  Continue reading for additional information.

The response will include each Territory’s ID, name, slug, initials and time zone.

By tracking the Event ID, you can update the content on your site as the new dates or prices are added to existing events.  *We strongly recommend that you update each event every time you access the feed to keep your data up to date.  If an event no longer appears in the feed, that means it's no longer available on Goldstar.*

The feed returns events in order of popularity, with the most popular events listed first.


#### Parameters:


You can tailor the results of the feed by passing parameters into the URL.  This will allow you to obtain events for a particular Territory, Category, date range, etc.  To create the parameter string, each parameter key and value should be encoded using the equals character (“=”) to create a key/value pair.  All key/value pairs should be concatenated together with the ampersand character (“&”).

| Property     | Type          | Description  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | 
| territory_id | integer | To limit the results to a specific Territory. Territory IDs can be found using the Territory call
| postal_code | integer | Adding postal_code is an alternative to territory_id. This will look up the postal_code's territory_id and scope the results based on the Territory.
| category_id | integer | Specifying category_id limits the results to a specific Category or Categories. You can get multiple Categories in one call.  Category IDs can be found using the Category call
| not_category_id | integer | This filters the results to exclude a specific Category
| from_date & to_date | strings |  This scopes your results to events with shows on the specified date or in the range.  Use the format YYYY-MM-DD. from_date can be used on its own, while to_date must be used in conjunction with from_date.  <br> <br> *For example,* to find all events with performances on January 1, 2017, add &from_date=2017-01-01&to_date=2017-01-10.  Add &from_date=2016-11-15 to find events with performances after November 11, 2016.  To find events with performances before a specific date, use &from_date=[current date]&to_date=[date specified]
| limit | integer | This reduces the number of results returned.  Since the results are sorted by popularity, this will give you the x most popular listings
| page & per_page | integers | These parameters can be used together to paginate the feed.  Use per_page to specify the number of events per page and page to specify the page

				Since dropping his breakthrough singles "The Wilhelm Scream" and his cover of Feist's

				collaborated with the likes of Beyoncé, Chance the Rapper and Drake and his moody, 
				haunting ballads have earned him a Mercury Prize, as well as a Grammy nod. With his 
				signature lilting vocals, heartfelt lyrics, layered synths and spare yet driving 
				beats, he's racked up one international hit after another, including "CMYK," "Life 
				Round Here" and "Retrograde." Now Blake heads to Santa Barbara's Arlington Theatre in 
				support of his critically acclaimed 2016 album "The Colour in Anything", which 
				features contributions from Frank Ocean, Rick Rubin and Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. 
				The theater's plush seating and elaborate al fresco décor make for the perfect 
				setting to take in intimate tracks like "Modern Soul" and "I Need a Forest Fire."

## Images

Our Listings feed includes the full size image for an event. To obtain different image sizes, you can use our Images API. This is the only API that does not require you to include your API key.


There are two ways to determine the base URL for an event image. First, you can use the listings API to find the image URL. In the example above, the image URL for the second event is `https://i.gse.io/gse_media/116/8/1474568117-kygo_tickets.jpg?p=1`.  Alternatively, you can find the event on <https://www.goldstar.com>, right-click on the event image, and select “Copy image address.”


#### Parameters

* `h=<pixels>` - To specify the maximum height (in pixels) for the image 
* `w=<pixels>` - To specify the maximum width (in pixels) for the image
* `c=1` - To crop the image. Use with the h & w options to get an exact size.
* `q=<quality>` - To adjust the jpeg compression (1-100)
* `p=1` - To use a progressive (interlaced) format if available


#### Example Requests
